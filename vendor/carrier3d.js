// plain functions on window (__carrier3dActivate, __carrier3dSyncOutriggers).
//
// Deliberately much simpler than cwt3d.js: no partMap, no click selection/
// highlighting, no explode logic - the carrier is one rigid chassis, its
// own real assembled position from the CAD export IS the intended view, and
// its materials already carry the crane's own Liebherr colours baked in
// from Onshape, so nothing needs recolouring either. One scene/renderer/
// camera/controls set, reused across cranes the same way cwt3d.js does,
// keyed model cache so switching back to an already-viewed carrier doesn't
// re-fetch/re-parse its (multi-MB) model.
//
// Outrigger tie-in (methodology.txt 10.77): the site plan's own leg/pad
// positions (mm, relative to the slew center - see index.html's
// cadFleetData/calcCAD) are mapped onto the loaded CAD model's own local
// coordinate space using FOOTPRINTS' front/rear/width figures (the same
// OEM-sourced numbers the 2D plan already uses for its clash-detection
// footprint rectangle) - NOT by rescaling the model, which is already
// dimensionally accurate from the CAD export. Only a per-crane
// CARRIER_CALIBRATION flag (index.html) is needed: which end of the
// model's own bounding box is the front, confirmed by rendering a
// straight-down view and visually identifying the driving cab. See
// methodology.txt 10.76/10.77 for how each crane's flag was derived.

// - only finds WHERE within that box the slew center sits.
//
// Anchored off the FRONT overhang only (front tip + FOOTPRINTS' own front
// distance), not off a front/rear proportional split of the model's whole
// measured length - a person caught this the hard way on the 1650 (see
// methodology.txt 59/60/61): that crane's exported mesh has the removable
// rear sliding beam box permanently baked in, so its measured length
// matches the box-ON total, not FOOTPRINTS' box-OFF total the proportional
// split assumed. Splitting a too-long measured length using a too-short
// total's ratio pushed the estimated slew centre about 1m too far toward
// the rear - every dimension line, ground-layout mark and AR anchor drawn
// off it inherited that same rearward shift, even though the plain mm
// figures (FOOTPRINTS, GROUND_LAYOUT_DATA, the rear-clearance toggle's own
// math) were always correct - only this 3D placement was wrong.
//
// Turned out not to be 1650-only: checked every crane's own exported mesh
// length against its FOOTPRINTS total, and every crane WITH a combi box
// (COMBI_BOX_DEPTH_MM - 1110/1130/1160/1250/1300) measured 400-630mm
// longer than its own box-OFF total, same story, smaller box; the one
// crane with neither box (1100, no COMBI_BOX_DEPTH_MM entry) measured
// within 6mm. Checked the OLD proportional-split formula's own slewZ
// against each crane's independently geometry-refined calibration (real
// outrigger foot-plate positions, refineCalibrationFromGeometry below -
// the closest thing to ground truth available) and it was off by
// 430-510mm on every combi-box crane, not just the 1650. This front-anchor
// formula lands within 15-210mm of that same ground truth on every crane
// tested (1650 excepted - no full leg geometry to refine against there,
// but checked directly against the model's own measured rear tip instead,
// within 11mm) - consistently closer than the old formula everywhere, and
// mathematically a no-op for any crane whose mesh happens to measure
// exactly FOOTPRINTS' own total (front+rear), so cranes without this
// problem see no change in behaviour. See methodology.txt 61 for the
// full per-crane comparison table. Nothing here depends on the model's
// total length or rear overhang at all, so a baked-in rear accessory on
// ANY crane's export (fitted or not, one of these or a future one) can't
// skew it - only a baked-in FRONT-end mismatch could, and no crane in
// this fleet has one.

// specific CAD export. When the model actually HAS outrigger geometry
// (not every crane's export does - LTM 1650's is missing one of the two
// beam pairs entirely, see 10.76/10.77), that geometry is a much better
// anchor than the formula: it's the real, exported thing, not a derived
// estimate.
//
// For each of the 4 corners, identifies the outrigger FOOT PLATE
// specifically (not the beam it's bolted to, not the jack cylinder above
// it, not incidental nearby hardware) and uses its bounding-box centre as
// the detected point, matched to its real P-id and fed into a per-axis
// least-squares line fit (site mm -> world metres) across however many
// legs' geometry could be confirmed - a per-axis LINE fit, not a single
// averaged offset applied uniformly to every leg, since a uniform
// translation can't correct a genuine per-leg/scale mismatch (only a
// constant frame offset). Falls back to the formula's own slope/intercept
// per-axis wherever fewer than 2 legs' geometry could be confirmed for
// that axis (checked against each leg's own known r, so a missing beam
// pair - like 1650's rear one - doesn't get "corrected" using some
// unrelated far-off part instead).
//
// Identifying "the foot plate" took three attempts before landing on

// down Top View (where camera-angle parallax can't be the explanation).

//      long rectangular BEAM's own extreme corner is a real vertex too
//      (unlike a round foot's bounding-box corner, which isn't a point on
//      the shape at all), so this just found the beam's own tip.
//   2. Most compact single MESH - also wrong: this Onshape export splits
//      every real part into hundreds of tiny per-face sub-meshes
//      (millimetre-scale bolt heads, decals, fillets - confirmed by
//      dumping every mesh within 1.5m of one corner and finding 500+ of
//      them), so "compact" just found some near-zero-size decal.
//   3. What works: aggregate sub-meshes back into their own PART first
//      (each real Onshape part occupies exactly one parent node in this
//      export), THEN filter to parts within 15cm of the model's own
//      lowest point (the foot plate TOUCHES THE GROUND - the cylinder

// occlusion hides different amounts of the line depending on view angle
// and how deep under the model's roofline the near point happens to sit.

// this model's world units by the plain /1000 unit conversion, same as
// every other physical dimension already drawn (pad sizes, etc).

// centre - i.e. straight to one side, matching the "parked parallel to
// the structure" worst case the numeric clearance figure itself assumes
// (see index.html's own disclaimer on that card). The rear dimension
// line runs along the carrier's own centerline instead, straight back
// from the slew centre - built via siteToWorld(cal, 0, mm) for BOTH its
// endpoints (the carrier's own rear edge and the circle's own rear-most
// point) rather than assuming +Z like the side line assumes +X, since
// siteToWorld's zSlope is the one thing here that already carries the
// correct sign per-crane (dirSign, computeFormulaCalibration's own
// comment: chosen so +Y/rear always maps to increasing world Z,
// regardless of which end of a given crane's own CAD export sits at min
// vs max Z) - hardcoding +Z here would silently point the wrong way on
// any crane calibrated with frontAtMinZ false. Both dimension lines are
// real 3D lines, so they're always geometrically correct from any camera
// angle, but like the circles themselves they read most clearly from a

//      site-plan coordinate. Clear of the carrier body the entire way,
//      labelled with the figure a crew reads off the OEM sheet.

// where you want a chosen ANCHOR POINT to sit, matching how a crew
// actually thinks about crane position, rather than some arbitrary point
// on the model's own bounding box that happens to be the CAD export's
// origin.
//
// anchor (optional): { xMm, yMm, legId } in the same site-space convention
// siteToWorld expects everywhere else in this file - null/omitted anchors
// on the slew centre (0,0), same as this always did before anchor
// existed. index.html's enterCarrier3DAR passes a specific leg's own
// site coordinates instead when its "what does the tap point represent"
// <select> is set to C1-C4 - the person's own request: a rigger who
// knows exactly where one outrigger needs to sit (a known hard point, an
// existing mat, a survey mark) can lock the tap to THAT leg instead of
// the slew centre.
//
// Anchoring rotation follows for free from anchoring placement, without
// any separate code path: arGroup's own local origin becomes whichever
// point (slew centre or the chosen leg) anchorPoint below resolves to,
// and rotateARModel() has always pivoted arGroup around ITS OWN origin -
// so once a leg is the anchor, rotating to dial in heading swings the
// model around that leg instead of the slew centre, keeping the leg
// locked to the tapped point exactly like a real crew would pivot a
// crane around one already-set outrigger rather than picking the whole
// machine up and putting it down again. This is the whole reason anchor
// threads through the position-placement code below rather than being a
// separate "anchor rotation" flag - the same one point does both jobs
// simultaneously, because a Group's origin always does both simultaneously.
//
// Only ever called for a model that's already loaded via the ordinary
// orbit preview (index.html only shows the AR button once that's true), so
// there's no loading state to handle here.
